# javaArrs
does something with an array and converts it into a array list for some reason

some idiot said:

"i basically have to make an array and make that array go through another method that takes out odd numbers and sorts largest to smallest and return the new arraylist"

so I took that as:

1)make an array in tester class
2)pass said array through method that takes out odd numbers
3)used picked array and sort it largest to smallest
4)return all of that as an array list
